**WALLPAPER README**

To use the glava.sh script, you first need to install pgrep, xorg-xdotool, and picom if they are not installed already. And glava, of course. If you do not have a 1920*1080 px monitor, you are a lot less cool than me, as you have, right in front of you, proof that you are not me. But also you'll probably need to change the position of the glava window (Right after "windowsize" in the glava.sh script, if you are unable to read).













I tried to find an artist to attribute to the wallpaper, but reverse image searching didn't show anything except the fact that it is based off of "Angel Beats!" (which, by the way, you need to watch if you haven't already. Best anime ever)
